 <p>Blue Lock is a Japanese sports manga and anime series that centers on soccer but with unique high-stakes twist. Japan's soccer team has consistently failed on the international stage, leading to the creation of an experimental program called Blue Lock. The program's goal is to develop Japan's next top striker by selecting 300 of the best high school forwards and pitting them against each other. Only one will succeed, and the rest will 144K be banned from representing Japan in soccer ever again.<br><br>
 
 The protagonist, Yoichi Isagi, joins Blue Lock after a personal failure on the soccer field. He realizes that his indecisiveness and lack of ego may have cost him and his team victory. Blue Lock challenges him to embrace selfishness and ambition, traits that are typically discouraged in team sports, in order to become a world-class striker. Along the way, Isagi faces numerous talented rivals, each with their own drive to win.<br><br>
 
 At the heart of the series is the tension between teamwork and egoism. Unlike traditional sports stories that emphasize team unity, Blue Lock encourages players to focus on their individual goals and talents. The mastermind behind the program, Ego Jinpachi, pushes the idea that only the most selfish and determined player can lead a team to victory. This creates a unique narrative that focuses on the internal struggles of the players as much as the action on the field.<br><br>
 
 The series stands out for its intense character rivalries and psychological depth. It's as much about personal growth as it is about soccer, with each player needing to understand their own strengths and weaknesses. The combination of high-pressure competition, strategic gameplay, and emotional stakes has made Blue Lock a popular and fresh take on the sports genre.</p>

<h3>1st Selection: Round-Robin</h3>
<p>Twenty-five teams are divided into five stratums or groups to perform a round-robin tourney; the top two teams of each stratum will move on to the next selection and the remaining three teams are expelled. However, the top scorer of each losing team will be allowed to advance to the next selection.</p>

<h3>2nd Selection</h3>
<p>125 strikers from each of the 5 stratums are left from the First Selection. The Second Selection is divided into 4 stages. It's a leveling system in which strikers are only allowed to move on after they clear each stage. Those who clear this selection will participate in a strengthening training camp with players from all around the world.<br><br>

The first stage is an individual match between a striker and BLUE LOCK MAN, a holographic goalkeeper. Players must score 100 goals within 90 minutes to pass within a limited area. After 30 goals, the difficulty increases as more holograms that are stationary are added acting as players forming a barrier. After 60 goals, the additional holograms begin moving quickly and the balls that are sent are faster and spinning. The system adjusts the quality and challenge of each ball based on the individual, making for a training that can draw out a player's unique style and weapons.<br><br>

The second stage is simply forming a three-man team. If players lose at the third stage, the second stage will then be a match between teams of 2 and the elimination stage of the Second Selection. The player on the losing team that fails to be picked up by the winners will be eliminated from the Blue Lock Project.<br><br>

The third stage is a match between teams of 3. The team that scores 5 goals first wins. The winning team takes one member from the losing team and continue on to the fourth stage. The losing team will have to return to the second stage.<br><br>

The fourth stage or clear stage is a match between teams of 4. The team that scores 5 goals first wins. The winning team takes one member from the losing team and continue on to the Third Selection. The losing team will have to return to the third stage.<br><br>

Those who are eliminated in the second stage are able to participate in a secret loser's qualifier, known as Wild Card that acts as a secondary way of advancement. It is a much more intense and unforgiving path of advancement as only one player actually survived the qualifier.

Only those who can create "chemical reactions" with others and combine their weapons to squash their rivals and show dominance will clear Second Selection.</p>

<h3>3rd Selection</h3>
<p>The Top 6 players are then paired up and broken into 3 teams; Team A, Team B, and Team C. The rest of the 29 strikers must then decide whose team they will play on in order to showcase and prove their skills in an attempt to be chosen for the Blue Lock Eleven and get to play against the Japan U-20.</p>
